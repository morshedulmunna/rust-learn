# Ownership - Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection

## Overview

The `ownership.rs` file demonstrates Rust's unique ownership system, which is the foundation of Rust's memory safety guarantees. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic ownership rules to advanced patterns like smart pointers, lifetimes, and custom types. Ownership rules prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences, dangling pointers, and data races at compile time.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Basic Ownership Rules

```rust
// RULE 1: Each value has exactly one owner (only heap-allocated values can be owned)
let s1 = String::from("hello");  // s1 is the owner of this heap-allocated String
let x = 5;  // x is NOT an owner - this is stack-allocated

// RULE 2: There can only be one owner at a time
let s2 = s1;  // s1's value MOVES to s2 (ownership transfer)
// println!("s1: {}", s1);  // COMPILE ERROR: s1 no longer owns the value!

// RULE 3: When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
{
    let s3 = String::from("world");
    println!("s3 in scope: '{}'", s3);
}  // s3 goes out of scope and is dropped (memory freed)

// STACK vs HEAP - Understanding Memory Allocation
let x = 5;  // Stack allocated - fixed size, fast access
let y = x;  // COPY (not move) - because i32 implements Copy trait

let s4 = String::from("hello");  // Heap allocated - dynamic size
let s5 = s4;  // MOVE (not copy) - ownership transferred
```

**Key Points:**

- **Rule 1**: Each heap-allocated value has exactly one owner
- **Rule 2**: When you assign a value to another variable, ownership is transferred (moved)
- **Rule 3**: When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped
- **Stack vs Heap**: Stack-allocated types are copied, heap-allocated types are moved
- **Copy trait**: Types that implement `Copy` are copied instead of moved

### 2. Ownership and Functions

```rust
// FUNCTION PARAMETERS - Ownership Transfer
let s = String::from("hello");
takes_ownership(s);  // s's value MOVES into the function
// println!("s: {}", s);  // COMPILE ERROR: s was moved!

// COPY TYPES - No Ownership Transfer
let x = 5;
makes_copy(x);  // x is COPIED (not moved) because i32 implements Copy
println!("x = {} (still valid)", x);

// RETURN VALUES - Ownership Transfer Back
let s1 = gives_ownership();  // Function gives ownership to s1
let s2 = String::from("hello");
let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 moves in, return value moves to s3

// OWNERSHIP FLOW - Understanding the Journey
let original = String::from("original");
let moved = original;  // Move 1: original → moved
let returned = takes_and_gives_back(moved);  // Move 2: moved → function → returned
```

**Key Points:**

- Passing a value to a function moves ownership
- Return values transfer ownership back to the caller
- Copy types (like `i32`) are copied, not moved
- Functions can take ownership and give it back
- Understanding ownership flow is crucial for Rust programming

### 3. References and Borrowing

```rust
// BORROWING - Access Without Ownership
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let len = calculate_length(&s1);  // &s1 creates a reference (borrow)
println!("s1 is still valid after borrowing!");

// IMMUTABLE REFERENCES - Read-Only Access
let s2 = String::from("hello");
// change(&s2);  // COMPILE ERROR: cannot borrow as mutable!

// MULTIPLE IMMUTABLE REFERENCES - Shared Read Access
let s3 = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &s3;  // First immutable reference
let r2 = &s3;  // Second immutable reference
let r3 = &s3;  // Third immutable reference
println!("All can read the same data simultaneously");

// REFERENCE LIFETIME - Understanding Scope
let s4 = String::from("hello");
{
    let r1 = &s4;  // Reference created
    println!("r1: '{}'", r1);
    // r1 goes out of scope here
}
println!("s4 is still valid: '{}'", s4);
```

**Key Points:**

- References allow you to refer to a value without taking ownership
- References are immutable by default
- You can have multiple immutable references to the same data
- References must always be valid (no dangling references)
- Reference scope is determined by their last use

### 4. Mutable References

```rust
// MUTABLE BORROWING - Modify Without Ownership
let mut s = String::from("hello");
change(&mut s);  // &mut s creates a mutable reference

// EXCLUSIVE MUTABLE ACCESS - Only One at a Time
let mut s1 = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &mut s1;  // First mutable reference
// let r2 = &mut s1;  // COMPILE ERROR: cannot borrow as mutable more than once!

// IMMUTABLE vs MUTABLE - Cannot Mix
let mut s2 = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &s2;  // Immutable reference
let r2 = &s2;  // Another immutable reference
// let r3 = &mut s2;  // COMPILE ERROR: cannot borrow as mutable!

// REFERENCE SCOPE - Understanding When References End
let mut s3 = String::from("hello");
{
    let r1 = &s3;  // Immutable reference
    let r2 = &s3;  // Another immutable reference
    // r1 and r2 go out of scope here
}
let r3 = &mut s3;  // Now we can have a mutable reference
```

**Key Points:**

- Mutable references allow you to modify the data they refer to
- You can have only one mutable reference to a piece of data at a time
- You cannot have a mutable reference while you have an immutable one
- The scope of references is determined by their last use
- This prevents data races at compile time

### 5. Slices

```rust
// STRING SLICES - References to String Data
let s = String::from("hello world");
let hello = &s[0..5];  // Slice from index 0 to 4 (exclusive)
let world = &s[6..11]; // Slice from index 6 to 10 (exclusive)

// Shorthand syntax
let hello_short = &s[..5];   // From start to index 4
let world_short = &s[6..];   // From index 6 to end
let full_short = &s[..];     // Entire string

// SLICE TYPE - &str
let s1 = String::from("hello world");
let word = first_word(&s1);
println!("word is of type &str (string slice)");

// ARRAY SLICES - References to Array Data
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..3];  // Slice from index 1 to 2 (exclusive)
println!("Slice type: &[i32]");
```

**Key Points:**

- Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements
- String slices are `&str` type
- Array slices are `&[T]` type
- Slices are references, so they don't have ownership
- Slices are useful for avoiding copying data
- Slices are bounds-checked at runtime

### 6. Ownership with Collections

```rust
// VECTOR OWNERSHIP - Collections Own Their Data
let mut v = Vec::new();
v.push(String::from("hello"));  // Vector takes ownership
v.push(String::from("world"));  // Vector takes ownership

// MOVING OUT OF COLLECTIONS
let first = v.remove(0);  // Ownership transferred from vector to first
println!("first now owns the String");

// ITERATION WITH OWNERSHIP
let v2 = vec![String::from("hello"), String::from("world")];
for s in v2 {  // v2 is MOVED into the for loop
    println!("String: '{}'", s);
    // s owns each String during iteration
}
// println!("v2: {:?}", v2);  // COMPILE ERROR: v2 was moved!

// ITERATION WITH REFERENCES
let v3 = vec![String::from("hello"), String::from("world")];
for s in &v3 {  // v3 is BORROWED (not moved)
    println!("String: '{}'", s);
    // s is a reference to each String
}
println!("v3 is still valid after iteration");

// ITERATION WITH MUTABLE REFERENCES
let mut v4 = vec![String::from("hello"), String::from("world")];
for s in &mut v4 {  // v4 is mutably borrowed
    s.push_str("!");  // Modify each String
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Collections own their data
- Moving out of collections transfers ownership
- Iterating with `for` moves the collection
- Iterating with `for &` borrows the collection
- Iterating with `for &mut` mutably borrows the collection
- Understanding iteration patterns is crucial for working with collections

### 7. Advanced Ownership Patterns

```rust
// CLONE - When You Need Ownership
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();  // Deep copy - both own their data
println!("Both s1 and s2 are valid after cloning");

// COPY TRAIT - Automatic Copying
let x = 5;
let y = x;  // Copy (not move) - because i32 implements Copy
println!("Copy is cheap and automatic for simple types");

// STRUCT OWNERSHIP - Fields Can Be Moved
let person = Person {
    name: String::from("Alice"),
    age: 30,
};
let name = person.name;  // person.name is moved out
// println!("person: {:?}", person);  // COMPILE ERROR: person.name was moved!

// BOX<T> - Heap Allocation with Single Ownership
let b = Box::new(5);  // Allocate on heap, b owns the Box

// RC<T> - Shared Ownership (Single Thread)
use std::rc::Rc;
let data = Rc::new(String::from("shared data"));
let data_clone1 = Rc::clone(&data);  // Share ownership
println!("Reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&data));

// ARC<T> - Thread-Safe Shared Ownership
use std::sync::Arc;
let shared_data = Arc::new(String::from("thread-safe data"));
let shared_clone = Arc::clone(&shared_data);
```

**Key Points:**

- `clone()` creates a deep copy when you need ownership
- `Copy` trait allows types to be copied instead of moved
- Struct fields can be moved individually
- `Box<T>` provides heap allocation with single ownership
- `Rc<T>` provides shared ownership within a single thread
- `Arc<T>` provides thread-safe shared ownership

### 8. Memory Management Deep Dive

```rust
// STACK vs HEAP - Detailed Comparison
// STACK:
// - Fixed size, known at compile time
// - Fast allocation and deallocation
// - Automatic cleanup when variable goes out of scope
// - LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure
// - Used for: local variables, function parameters

// HEAP:
// - Dynamic size, unknown at compile time
// - Slower allocation and deallocation
// - Manual cleanup via ownership system
// - Can be fragmented
// - Used for: large data, data that outlives function

// OWNERSHIP AND MEMORY SAFETY
// 1. No null pointer dereferences
// 2. No dangling pointers
// 3. No double frees
// 4. No use-after-free errors
// 5. No data races (with proper borrowing)

// MEMORY LEAK PREVENTION
// - Automatic cleanup when owner goes out of scope
// - No manual memory management required
// - Compiler ensures all memory is freed
// - No garbage collection overhead
```

**Key Points:**

- Understanding stack vs heap is crucial for performance
- Ownership system provides memory safety without garbage collection
- Rust prevents common memory errors at compile time
- No manual memory management required
- Memory leaks are prevented by the ownership system

### 9. Ownership with Custom Types

```rust
// CUSTOM STRUCTS - Owned vs Borrowed Fields
let person = Person {
    name: String::from("Alice"),  // Owned field
    age: 30,                      // Copy field
};

// MOVING STRUCT FIELDS
let name = person.name;  // Move the owned field
// println!("person: {:?}", person);  // person.name is no longer valid

// COPY STRUCT FIELDS
let age = person.age;  // Copy the Copy field
println!("person.age is still valid: {}", person.age);

// CUSTOM TYPES WITH REFERENCES
let text = String::from("hello world");
let word = first_word(&text);
println!("word is a reference to part of text");

// OWNERSHIP IN ENUMS
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Message {
    Quit,                           // No data
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },        // Copy data
    Write(String),                  // Owned data
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),     // Copy data
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Structs can have both owned and borrowed fields
- Moving struct fields affects the struct's validity
- Copy fields remain valid after assignment
- Enums can contain different types of data
- Understanding ownership in custom types is essential

### 10. Advanced Borrowing Patterns

```rust
// BORROWING WITH LIFETIMES
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}

let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
let string2 = String::from("xyz");
let result = longest(&string1, &string2);

// BORROWING WITH STRUCTS
#[derive(Debug)]
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}

let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
let i = ImportantExcerpt { part: first_sentence };

// BORROWING WITH ITERATORS
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().sum();
println!("numbers is still valid: {:?}", numbers);

// BORROWING WITH CLOSURES
let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut borrows_mutably = || list.push(7);
borrows_mutably();
```

**Key Points:**

- Lifetimes ensure references remain valid
- Structs can contain references with lifetimes
- Iterators work with borrowing patterns
- Closures can borrow data mutably or immutably
- Advanced borrowing patterns enable complex data structures

## Common Patterns

### Avoiding Moving with References

```rust
// Instead of moving
fn process_string(s: String) -> String {
    // Process s
    s
}

let s = String::from("hello");
let result = process_string(s);
// s is no longer valid here

// Use references to avoid moving
fn process_string_ref(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

let s = String::from("hello");
let len = process_string_ref(&s);
// s is still valid here
```

### Clone When You Need Ownership

```rust
let original = String::from("hello");
let copy = original.clone();  // Create a copy when you need both
println!("original: {}, copy: {}", original, copy);
```

### Using Slices for Efficiency

```rust
// Instead of taking ownership
fn first_word_owned(s: String) -> String {
    // Find first word and return owned String
}

// Use slices for efficiency
fn first_word_slice(s: &str) -> &str {
    // Find first word and return slice
}
```

### Smart Pointers for Shared Ownership

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

// When you need multiple owners
let data = Rc::new(String::from("shared"));
let owner1 = Rc::clone(&data);
let owner2 = Rc::clone(&data);

// All can use the data
println!("data: {}, owner1: {}, owner2: {}", data, owner1, owner2);
```

### Advanced Borrowing with Lifetimes

```rust
// Function with explicit lifetime
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}

// Struct with lifetime parameter
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use references when you don't need ownership**
2. **Clone only when you actually need a copy**
3. **Use slices to avoid unnecessary copying**
4. **Prefer `&str` over `&String` for function parameters**
5. **Use smart pointers (`Rc`, `Arc`) for shared ownership**
6. **Understand the difference between `Copy` and `Clone`**
7. **Use lifetimes to ensure reference validity**
8. **Understand stack vs heap allocation**
9. **Use appropriate iteration patterns with collections**
10. **Design custom types with ownership in mind**

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Trying to use moved value

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s;  // s is moved to s2
println!("s: {}", s);  // This will not compile!
```

### ✅ Use references to avoid moving

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let s2 = &s;  // s2 borrows s
println!("s: {}, s2: {}", s, s2);  // Both work
```

### ❌ Multiple mutable references

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;  // This will not compile!
```

### ✅ Use one mutable reference at a time

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
{
    let r1 = &mut s;
    println!("r1: {}", r1);
}  // r1 goes out of scope
let r2 = &mut s;  // Now this works
```

### ❌ Dangling references

```rust
fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s  // This will not compile!
}
```

### ✅ Return owned data

```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s  // Return owned String
}
```

### ❌ Ignoring lifetime requirements

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {  // Missing lifetime parameter
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}
```

### ✅ Use explicit lifetimes

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}
```
